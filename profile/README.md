*gonna be real i suck at read me files*

AWFixerOS is an operating system with a planned evolution that will allow it to overcome current limitations in the open source ecosystem.

We have a goal of writing all parts of the Operating System in nix and rust for speed and reproducible builds.

## What is AWFixerOS?

AWFixerOS takes its inspiration from the following sources:

- the brain of [AWFixer]

## What is it going to do?

AWFixerOS is going to do some fun things. I have composed a list of some below:

- run a Microkernel
  - you can see the current code for this in the [kernel-v2] repo
- have it's own anti cheat software
