# AWFixerOS

AWFixerOS is an operating system with a planned evolution that will allow it to overcome current limitations in the open source ecosystem.

we are [here](https://inv.wtf/deadinside)

We have a goal of writing all parts of the Operating System in nix and rust for speed and reproducible builds.

## What is AWFixerOS?

AWFixerOS takes its inspiration from the following sources:
- [NixOS]
- [Nix]
- [RedoxOS]
- the brain of [AWFixer]
- more soon

## What is it going to do

AWFixerOS is going to do some fun things. I have composed a list of some below:

- run a Microkernel
  - you can see the current code for this in the [kernel-v2] repo
- have it's own anti cheat software
- solve a lot of problems on my list of [autistic problems]

## Roadmap

- Q4 2025 (right now)

Project Organization. I have been sick for a while and I'm back to work on this after approximately 2 years of trying to return.

I have been assembling a base team of a couple designers, a web developer, a developer competent in Rust, and our other needs are Elixir, Gleam, IoC and DevOps. We are considering an AI Specialist in the future.

your able to read more about it on the [AWFixer and Friends] website 

- Q1 2026

this when I plan on releasing the first sub dev, pre alpha edition of AWOS (some weird code like v0.0.1-rc-blah-alpha) that contains a lot of the visual components we want, running on the Linux Kernel with the Cosmic Desktop Environment and our welcome app. From here I will work on assembling a dedicated team of testers and start releasing many of our projects abd experimental features like:

   - Path and Hash based Encryption
   - OS Based non invasive Anti Cheat Software and DRM (read more [here](hackertalks.blog/anticheat-is-the-devil))


## Contributing

one thing that I am aware of is that this project will inevitably cause me to "threaten" or "kill" other projects. Both intentionally and as a sort of collatoral damage. I have been aware of this as I continue to plan out AWFixerOS and have decided that while RedHat can eat my whole dick, same with things like CNCF and the Linux Foundation, the smaller projects that we use and end up doing damage too - they are the ones I will continue to care about. So if you as a maintainer of a project you find being damaged by this OS, would like to contribute then shoot me an email [here](mailto:theautist@theautist.me) and I will see about getting you, and your project, encorporated into our project so that you can benefit from what we build here, rather than be damaged by it.

Outside of that contributing to this project is very strict for security and quality reasons. We will write documentation for it one of these days, for now it will have to pass a very long line of human written, ai written, and automated checks to ensure that you code does what you say and keeps our products doing what we want them to do. Expect to be sent back a few times before being added to the merge que.


## Donating/Sponsoring

I am structuring this project so that you can sponsor via [GitHub Sponsors] to get access to a lot of github based features. You also have the option to sponsor via [Patreon], [Ko-Fi], [BuyMeACoffee], or Paypal and [CashApp]


## Community

our community is on [Discord]. When you join the Discord you will have to apply, which is something we use to keep the community safe. We look forward to seeing what you contribute to our community.

more information soon :tm:
